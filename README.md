Hello, I am Jeremy Hutcherson. I am currently in the process of trying to get a grasp on Python 3.XXX. I have read "Byte of Python" in its entirety, and am currently working through "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way." I hope to complete this book within the next two weeks, and, hopefully, once I finish will be able to start contributing to Python code on GitHub!
